# Simple Classifiers

Another implementation exercise on writing common ML packages. This is the best way to learn.

## Naive Bayes
Start by implementing continuous feature input:
### Gaussian Normals
$p(x|y=k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma_k^2}}e^{-(x-\mu_k)^2/(2\sigma_k^2)}$

## Logistic Regression
Start by implementing LR with explicit solver, and logit:
