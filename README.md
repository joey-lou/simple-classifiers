# Simple Classifiers

Another implementation exercise on writing common ML packages.  

## Naive Bayes
Different models available for input features: `gaussian`, `bernoulli`, `multi-nomial`.

Currently only `gaussian` is implemented.
### Gaussian Normals

## Logistic Regression
Binary logistic regression uses cross entroy loss.

Multi-class can use either `ovr` or `multi-nomial`
